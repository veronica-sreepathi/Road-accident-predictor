Road Accident Predictor – README

📌 Introduction

Road accidents are a major global issue caused by factors such as weather, traffic, road conditions, and human behaviour.
This project, Road Accident Predictor, aims to use machine learning concepts to predict the likelihood of a road accident under certain conditions.
The goal is to support safer transportation, better traffic management, and informed decision-making.
